             Our maps are a work in progress, and as we made them, we have seen many of their limitations. As we endeavour to improve them, we welcome your feedback and suggestions. 
             
             Specifically, as you access and use these maps, here are a few points about the map to be mindful of:
             * These maps largely pertain to the Semi-Arid Lowland regions of India, i.e., areas <= 1,000 m ASL elevation, receiving <= 1200 mm annual rainfall, and may not be directly applicable to other regions. While we have not masked results from areas of higher rainfall, or greater elevations, our labels may not work best in such areas.
             * Much of the imagery used in our input composites come from the period 2019-2021, and are often aggregated over that period. This means that while our maps, on average, capture the pulse of that period, they do not represent a precise slice of time, but more a smear of time extending over those 3 years.
             * Categorising and distinguishing particular land cover types pose both conceptual and practical challenges. Drawing lines at where 'Bare and Sparsely Vegetated Areas' end and where 'Open Savannas' begin, or for that matter, where 'Woodland Savannas' end and 'Forests' begin, are difficult, and to some extent, based on arbitrary thresholds. In nature, these ecosystems/ecotypes seamlessly intergrade, whereas we are constrained to assign them a single label in our map. As a result, our assignments may not always be accurate. To acknowledge this uncertainty, we have made available the entire vector of label probabilities. So, if you find that an area you know to be 'Open Savanna' is labelled 'Agriculture-Low Biomass', please also look at the probability values for both these categories; you may find them to be close to each other. Feel free to use these probability values creatively to incorporate the uncertainty in our maps into your downstream analyses. There are particular pairs of labels where such errors of ommision and commission are more common. They are:
                 * Agriculture-Low Biomass and Open Savannas (especially so in rainfed areas)
                 * Agriculture-High Biomass and Forests/Woodland Savannas (especially crops such as coffee, areca nut, and rubber)
                 * Open Savannas and Shrub Savannas
                 * Woodland Savannas and Forests
             * While we have made every effort to ensure that our labels are as accurate as possible, we are aware that there are many areas where our labels may not be accurate. We are working to improve these labels, and welcome your feedback on how we can do so.
